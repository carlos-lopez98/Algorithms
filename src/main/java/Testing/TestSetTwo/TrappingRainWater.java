/**
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
 * compute how much water it can trap after raining.
 *
 *Example 2:
 * Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
 * Output: 9
 *
 * Constraints:
 * n == height.length
 * 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
 * 0 <= height[i] <= 105
