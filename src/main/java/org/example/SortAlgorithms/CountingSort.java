/**
 * This Algorithm assumes the elements to be sorted are within a given range.
 *
 * The range will be passed into our method, as a max and min, so the range is max - min
 *
 * With the range included, we can create a temp array that stores the counts of numbers min to max
 *
 * With the counts, we are able to place the elements from min to max back into the input array in the correct order
