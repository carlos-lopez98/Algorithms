/**
 * Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x
 * Come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. (Important) the partition element x can appear anywhere in the
 * "right partition" it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
 *
 * Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1
 *
 * OutPut: 3 -> 1 -> 2       ->      10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
 *
 * Notice how 5 does not have to be in the center, it's just left partition is elements less than 5
 * Right partition is elements greater than 5
