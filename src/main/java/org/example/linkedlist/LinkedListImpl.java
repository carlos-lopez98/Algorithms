 *This class is to go over how to implement a linkedlist structure

//Ask yourself what is needed in a linkedlist?
//How does a linkedlist work exactly?
//1. Linked lists have a head and tail node, the list can access at O(1) runtime
//2. LinkedLists must traverse from the head to get to a specific node/ data, unless it's a doubly linked list
//3. To remove a data point, you must remove the reference to that particular node in order to remove it from the list
