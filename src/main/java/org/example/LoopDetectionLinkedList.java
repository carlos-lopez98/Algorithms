    //! You can solve this use hashing - loop through your original list
    // Add the nodes to hashmap as you go using their addresses as the hashvalue
    //If you run into the same value then there is a cycle, and that value is the new start
    //of a loop



    //Second way is to use the tortaise and hare algorithm
