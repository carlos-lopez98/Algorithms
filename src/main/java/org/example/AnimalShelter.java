* An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in first out" basis
* People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter,
* or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type).
* They cannot select a particular animal. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations
* such as enqueue, dequeueany, dequeueDog, dequeueCat. You may use the built in linkedList data structure
