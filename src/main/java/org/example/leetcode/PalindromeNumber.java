/*
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

//For some problems you have to think mathematically to get to the optimal solution
//You can solve this one by converting the number to a string, and then iterating through it
//How would you solve it if you couldn't iterate through it? This is where the mathematical thinking comes in


//For Review - how do you reverse a number, using a while loop?
//What variables should you keep track of?
//How do you shrink your while loop condition?
