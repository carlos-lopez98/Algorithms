*
* You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.
* The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
* Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
*
* (You can't just convert the linked list into an integer)
*
* Input: 7 -> 1 -> 6 + 5 -> 9 -> 2 = 2 -> 1 > 9
* Output: 912
