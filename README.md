# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repo is where I practice solving algorithmic challenges and reinforce fundamental DSA concepts — one problem at a time.

---

## 🧠 What's in this Repo?

This collection includes problems from:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/cjimenez9811)
- _Cracking the Coding Interview_ by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
- Common Java coding questions

Problems are organized by topic (arrays, strings, trees, etc.) and include:

- ✅ My solution
- 💡 Notes or comments embedded directly in the code

## 🛠 Languages & Tools

| Tool / Language | Purpose                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Java**         | Main language for problem solving |
| **IntelliJ IDEA**| IDE used for development          |

## ✍️ Why This Exists

Learning DSA isn’t about memorizing solutions — it’s about pattern recognition, confidence, and clean thinking. This repo is both my scratchpad and my progress log.

Feel free to explore, learn from my mistakes, or fork it for your own practice.
